The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together researchers,
developers, and students in order to advance the theory of concurrency, and
promote its applications.

Amid the recent COVID-19 situation, the organization committee decided that
QONFEST 2020, and thus also CONCUR 2020 will be organized on-line. Accepted
papers will be published as planned, by September 2020, but no physical
meeting/presentations will take place.  We plan that the authors will record
their talks and discuss them with the conference participants online.  All
CONCUR 2020 deadlines have been adjusted with __two weeks deadline
extensions__.

## TOPICS

Submissions are solicited in semantics, logics, verification and analysis of
concurrent systems. The principal topics include (but are not limited to):

 * Basic models of concurrency such as abstract machines, domain-theoretic
 models, game-theoretic models, process algebras, graph transformation systems,
 Petri nets, hybrid systems, mobile and collaborative systems, probabilistic
 systems, real-time systems, biology-inspired systems, and synchronous systems;

 * Logics for concurrency such as modal logics, probabilistic and stochastic
 logics, temporal logics, and resource logics;

 * Verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems such as abstract
 interpretation, atomicity checking, model checking, race detection, pre-order
 and equivalence checking, run-time verification, state-space exploration,
 static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving, type systems, and
 security analysis;

 * Distributed algorithms and data structures: design, analysis, complexity,
 correctness, fault tolerance, reliability, availability, consistency,
 self-organization, self-stabilization, protocols;

 * Theoretical foundations of architectures, execution environments, and software
 development for concurrent systems such as geo-replicated systems,
 communication networks, multiprocessor and multi-core architectures, shared
 and transactional memory, resource management and awareness, compilers and
 tools for concurrent programming, programming models such as component-based,
 object- and service-oriented.

## PAPER SUBMISSION

CONCUR 2020 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or
experience related to the topics mentioned below. All papers must be original,
unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere.

Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. The paper may be
supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at the
discretion of the program committee.

The CONCUR 2020 proceedings will be published by LIPIcs.

Papers must be submitted electronically as PDF files via
    [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=concur20).

Papers must not exceed 14 pages (excluding references and clearly marked
appendices) using the [LIPIcs
style](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/)

## SPECIAL ISSUE

A special issue dedicated to selected papers from CONCUR 2020 will appear in
Logical Methods in Computer Science.
