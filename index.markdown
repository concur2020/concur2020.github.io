The purpose of CONCUR 2020, the 31st International Conference on Concurrency
Theory, is to bring together researchers, developers, and students in order to
advance the theory of concurrency, and promote its applications.


Amid the recent COVID-19 situation, the organization committee decided that
QONFEST 2020, and thus also CONCUR 2020 will be organized on-line. Accepted
papers will be published as planned, by September 2020, but no physical
meeting/presentations will take place.  We plan that the authors will record
their talks and discuss them with the conference participants online.  All
CONCUR 2020 deadlines have been adjusted with __two weeks deadline
extensions__.

CONCUR 2020 is part of the umbrella conference
[QONFEST 2020](http://qonfest2020.conf.tuwien.ac.at/index.html)
comprising the joint international 2020 meetings CONCUR,
